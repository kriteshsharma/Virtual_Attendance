# Virtual_Attendance

This project can recognise faces of persons that are labelled as subjects in the code and can mark the time when it detects that face.
Subjects is a folder that contains the images of the persons that are to be recognised.
The CSV file will be created autmatically where the time and name of the person will be saved.
The subject images will be saved in csv as per the image file name.
The code might work slow when it detects the face as it checks too many features.
Only 1 image is necessary to identify the person.
A bounding box and the label of the image will be shown in realtime on screen.
